This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')`.  The error occurs when trying to access a property of an object that is null or undefined. The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` shows how to fix it using optional chaining and nullish coalescing.  This is a frequent issue when working with asynchronous data or prop drilling, highlighting the importance of robust error handling and data validation in React Native applications.
