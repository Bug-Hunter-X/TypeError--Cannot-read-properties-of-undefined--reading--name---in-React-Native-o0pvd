This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  This is a common issue in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching or prop drilling.  For example, consider the following code:

```javascript
const MyComponent = ({ user }) => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{user.name}</Text> 
    </View>
  );
};
```

If `user` is null or undefined before the data is fetched, accessing `user.name` will throw this error.
